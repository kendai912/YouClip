(ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. </li> <li> <span class='underline'>Arbitrator.</span> Any arbitration between you and YouClip will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<strong >AAA Rules</strong >”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href='http://www.adr.org'>www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting YouClip.The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. </li> <li> <span class='underline'>Notice; Process.</span> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail or email (“<strong>Notice</strong>”). YouClip’s address for Notice is: youclipteam@gmail.com. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”).The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or YouClip may commence an arbitration proceeding.During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or YouClip must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by YouClip prior to selection of an arbitrator, then YouClip will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by YouClip in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $15,000. </li> <li> <span class='underline'>Fees.</span> If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, YouClip will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse YouClip for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. </li> <li> <span class='underline'>No Class Actions.</span> YOU AND YouClip AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and YouClip agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. </li> <li> <span class='underline' >Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</span > Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, if YouClip makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to YouClip’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to YouClip’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and YouClip. </li> <li> <span class='underline'>Enforceability.</span> If Section 10.f above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 10 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 10 will be null and void. </li> </ol> <li class='list-top-heading'> Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties. </li> <p> <strong >THE PROVISIONS IN THIS SECTION 11 APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW</strong >: </p> <ol class='lower-latin'> <li> YouClip, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE&nbsp;“<strong>YouClip PARTIES</strong>”) MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, OR RELIABILITY THEREOF.THE YouClip PARTIES WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR THE TRUTH, ACCURACY, OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY CONTENT OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION CONVEYED TO ANY user, OR FOR ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR OMISSIONS THEREIN, OR FOR ANY DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS OF THE DATA OR INFORMATION STREAM FROM WHATEVER CAUSE.TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AS A user, YOU AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT AT YOUR OWN RISK. </li> <li> THE YouClip PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL OPERATE ERROR FREE, OR THAT THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR SIMILAR CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES.IF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, NO YouClip PARTY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS. </li> <li> THE SERVICE AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE YouClip PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. </li> <li> IN NO EVENT WILL ANY YouClip PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH YouClip PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
